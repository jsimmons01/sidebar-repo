# Sidebar Repo

## Description
Show and hide sidebar when button is clicke

## What did I learn?
I made the mistake and switch my toggleSidebar and sidebar buttons. When I did this nothing was happening. I need to double check to make sure my variables are pointing to the correct class. I also learned to use the variable in the correct order because I used toggleSidebar as an listener and I put it in my condional when I only needed the sidebar. 

This project was simple and very similar to the navbar project.
